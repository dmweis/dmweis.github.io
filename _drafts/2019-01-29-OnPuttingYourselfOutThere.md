# On putting yourself out there

_Or how I need to post more stuff online_

I became vegan about a year ago. Wait! Don't leave! This isn't going where you think it is. The V word is only used once in this article.  
THe reason I am bringing this up is the reason I went vegan. (Damn.... Well I guess I am gonna use it twice)  
I am a dreamer (*And I am not the only one...*). SO I often visualize who I would like to be in the future. The problem with this visualization is that at some point it can become stressful. Especially if you realize you are getting to an age where you visualized yourself as someone and you are not that person.  

For me there were always few traits that future David shared. He was more politically active, more environmentally conscious... the problem with visualizing things you want to be is that you often times forget to plan for how to get there. I think that the way you become things is by doing things. Sometimes this is obvious. Sometimes it isn't. In either case it's a lot easier to imagine you being something than to go through with doing something until you become that thing.  

One of the things I always onted to be was one of those developers that you can just google and see all the cool stuff that they did. THere are a few reason for this. One is that I always respected those people. Other is that a lot of what I learned about engineering, software, and technology comes from these people. As Many developers nowadays; when I started I didn't learn by reading documentation or datasheets. I started by reading a blog post about something cool someone did and trying to replicate it. 

I actaully still remeber the originally project that inspired me to hack things and make robots. It's [this one.](https://www.jbprojects.net/projects/wifirobot/)
_If I didn't search for this blog post I would have never found out that this person is now

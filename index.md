# Hi, I'm David!

*Welcome to my new revamped page!!!*

I am a Software Engineer from Slovakia, currently residing in Scotland.  
I used to be a software engineer working in Air Traffic control in Denmark, but I got bored with my job one day and decided to move to Edinburgh and get a degree in Robotics instead. Now most of my days consist of skipping classes, teaching workshops and building robots.  

~~This site doubles as a personal blog and a light portfolio, but it's current only updated sporadically (Mostly whenever I get bored...)~~  
^ is what the site used to say, and it's still very much true, but I am working on the sporadically part.

If you are interested in some of my projects I recommend that you check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/dmweis)  

Or if you are interested in offering me a job or checking out what am I up to these days you can take a peek at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-michael-weis/)

## Where is David?

I recently started working on a small webapp that could tell you my current location. I decided to do this since I am pretty bad at quickly answering messages from my friends and so that my parents could check if I moved in the past 24 hours since I am also pretty bad at answering their messages and they live pretty far. ```Sorry mom!```

*This project is not yet finished. You can check it's very slow progress on my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/dmweis/where-is-david) my hope was that posting the link here will force me to work on it more*
